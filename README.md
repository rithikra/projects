# Projects
The following files are a showcase of projects I have worked on in the past. 

- BST_AVL:
  Created a BST class and extended the class to an AVL tree (self balancing tree);
  Used this class and recursion/backtracking to create an algorithm to uniquely color maps (4 colors only) without any borders touching
  
 - git_mini:
  Built a localized version of Git, a version control system integrating commands including “add”, “create”, “log”, “checkout”, and “tags” using a variety of data      structures in C++’s STL;
  Integrated Git’s difference-oriented functionality only saving changes rather than overwriting files between commits allowing users to view additions and           deletions between commits

- image_processor: utilized dynamically allocated 3D arrays and convolution and padding techniques to implement kernel-based image processing algorithms, mimicking Adobe Photoshop’s blur and sharpening filters known as Gaussian Blur, Unsharp Mask, and Sobel

- sequence_differences: wrote python script to recursively analyze differences between genome sequences allowing for two mutations between sequences

- search_engine:
  created a page and MD parser to sort through text and save incoming and outgoing links;
  created a crawler to crawl through different webpages and process all possible webpages through DFS;
  utilized pagerank algorithm to allow users to query search allowing for AND,OR, & NAND queries;
  created search_engine that utilized combination of past 3 techniques to allow users to search through different webpages
